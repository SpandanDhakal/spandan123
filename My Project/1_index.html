                        <li>At the foot of the Himalayas, Chitwan is one of the few remaining undisturbed vestiges of the 'Terai' region, which formerly extended over the foothills of India and Nepal. It has a particularly rich flora and fauna. One of the last populations of single-horned Asiatic rhinoceros lives in the park, which is also one of the last refuges of the Bengal tiger. The spectacular landscape, covered with lush vegetation and the Himalayas as the backdrop makes the park an area of exceptional natural beauty. The forested hills and changing river landscapes serve to make Chitwan one of the most stunning and attractive parts of Nepal’s lowlands. Situated in a river valley basin and characterized by steep cliffs on the south-facing slopes and a mosaic of riverine forest and grasslands along the river banks of the natural landscape makes the property amongst the most visited tourist destination of its kind in the region. The property includes the Narayani (Gandaki) river, the third-largest river in Nepal which originates in the high Himalayas and drains into the Bay of Bengal providing dramatic river views and scenery as well as the river terraces composed of layers of boulders and gravels.</li>

                            <li>One of the most sacred Hindu temples of Nepal – Pashupatinath Temple is located on both banks of Bagmati River on the eastern outskirts of Kathmandu.

                             <li>Patan, also known as ‘Lalitpur’, the city of artisans, lies 5 km southeast of Kathmandu, and is home to the valley’s finest craftsmen who have preserved such ancient techniques as the repoussé  and lost wax process used to produce exquisite sculptures. The city retains much of the old charm with its narrow streets, brick houses and multitude of well-preserved Hindu temples, Buddhist monasteries (vihars) and monuments. The predominant sound in Patan is that of the tinkering of craftsmen bent over the statuettes they are shaping. As in Kathmandu, Hinduism and Buddhism have co-existed here for ages, influencing each other, and the religious harmony is exemplary.Krishna temple is the most important temple in Patan Durbar Square.A three-storied structure, it was built in the local variety of Shikhara style called Granthakuta.The stone carvings along the beam above the first and second-floor pillar are most notable. The first-floor pillar carvings narrate the events of the Mahabharata, while on the second floor there are visual carvings from Ramayana.The temple was built in 1667 by King Siddhi Narsingh Malla.[11] It is said that one night the King saw Lord Krihis consort Srimati Radha standing in front of the royal palace. He ordered a temple to be built on the same spare 21 golden pinnacles in the temple. Below the pinnacles are three stories. The first floor holds the main sLord Krishna with shrines of Radha and Rukmini at each side. The second floor is dedicated to Lord Shiva and the Lokeshwor (Avalokiteshvara).</li>

                            <li>Pokhara’s tranquil beauty has been the subject of inspiration for many travel writers. Its pristine air, spectacular backdrop of snowy peaks, blue lakes and surrounding greenery make it ‘the jewel in the Himalaya’, a place of remarkable natural disposition. With the magnificent Annapurna range forming the backdrop and the serenity of the Cluster of 9 Lakes with three major ones - Phewa, Rupa and Begnas – Pokhara is a great destination for a weekend getaway as well as a long relaxing holiday. Pokhara Valley, gateway to the Annapurna region where many a trekker finds his Shangri-la, sits high on the list of ‘must visit’ places in Nepal.Pokhara once lay on the important trade route between India and Tibet. To this day, mule trains set up camps on the city outskirts, bringing goods from remote Himalayan regions including Mustang. Gurungs and Magars, who have earned worfame as fierce Gurkha warriors, are predominant here. Thakalis, indigenous of the Thak Khola region of Mustang, arfor their entrepreneurship and run tea houses along the trek routes in the Annapurna region. The Pokhara is best knthe stunning view of the Annapurna range. It is perhaps one of the few places on earth from where mountains above can be seen unobstructed from an altitude of 800 m within the distance of 28 km. </li>

                                <li>The Annapurna Region in northwestern Nepal has been touted as having the world’s best trekking routes. From the lake city of Pokhara, popular treks lead to Jomsom, Annapurna Base Camp, Mustang, Manang and around the Annapurna mountain. Short treks to Sikles and Ghandruk are just as popular. The Annapurna region is an area of contrasts comprising the wettest, driest and windiest places in Nepal. The Annapurna Circuit:<br>
                                    It is by far the most popular and requires a minimum of about three weeks to go around the Annapurna massif. What makes this trek so special is that you can look up to something new in scenery every day. The Annapurna Conservation Area begins at 790 m and reaches a high of 8,091 m, the summit of Mount Annapurna I, the world’s 10th tallest peak. The area encompasses forested middle mountain, high Himalaya and trans-Himalayan desert plateau similar to the landscape in Tibet as you move north. The lower elevations are dotted by Gurung, Magar, Thakali, and Brahmin villages while Tibetan cultural influence becomes apparent as you go north. The trek goes counter-clockwise from Besi Sahar, off the Pokhara-Kathmandu Highway, to Naya Pool, and reaches its high point at Thorong La, a pass at 5,416 m. On the way, you pass through stunning mountain scenery – Manaslu, Langtang Himal, Annapurna II and IV, Annapurna III, and, Annapurna I and Dhaulagiri. In between these two 8,000m peaks lies the dramatic Kali Gandaki gorge – the deepest in the world.<br><br>
                                    <b>Upper Mustang:</b> Mustang offers an experience of trans-Himalayan landscape and exotic Himalayan cultural experience. Muktinath (3,749 m) is a popular destination for pilgrims and trekkers to the region. It is a site holy for both Buddhists and Hindus before. There is now a motorable road from Muktinath to Beni, from where you can catch a bus to Pokhara. Also, you can catch a bus from Besi Sahar to Sanghe at the start of the trek.<br>
                                    Lo-Manthang in Upper Mustang is an extremely exotic destination too. The last king of Mustang still has his home in this ancient capital township. Many tourists visit Lo-Manthang during Teej festival that is usually scheduled in the month of May.<br>
                                    Being in the rain shadow area, Upper Mustang can be visited even during the rainy season. Upper Mustang falls in protected areas and one need special permit to visit the region.<br><br>
                                    <b>Manang:</b> The trek in the eastern part follows the Marsyangdi River upstream till Manang, which is a string of seven villages that form the upper arc of the Annapurna Circuit Trekking Trail. The area is composed of stark, rocky terrain, very similar to the Tibetan plateau, and is dotted with turquoise lakes, including Lake Tilicho (4919 m), the world’s highest lake.
